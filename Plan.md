Variables such as self.turtle, turtle_shapes, turtle_colors, startx, starty, etc. are all incredibly important and useful in order to do this project. By specifically naming each one, it allows for an easier coding experience as well as simpler to distinct which variable did what. Conditions that are used are the __init__ which checks for erros in the shape and color values to make sure they are valid and work.
