# Activity 1.1.7

---

2. Implement by creating a class that contains the following:

Data Structure to store the turtles
Data Structure to store the colors
A public method that contains a loop to iterate through the data structure.
An __str__ method on the class to print out step 6 -- for the turles, what specific information would be useful?
An __init__ method to set the turtles to the data structure
Be sure include error checks and documentation on the read me to utilize the class you create.
 

3. Action Items

In order to extend the code, I added more items to the list and changed the "for i in range(6)" to "for i in range(8)" so it would continue the pattern and extend the amount of sides the shape had in order to fully complete the pattern.

## Questions about the Activity as you work. 
```
What is the purpose of the class?

What happens if their is a value error?

What is the purpose of the __str__ method?
```
#### Description Of The App 

1.1.7 is an app that uses Turtle in order to create a colorful design using shapes and colors stored in a list to create a geometric shape. Using data structures in order to store the turtles and the colors and make it easier to append or remove items from the list without making to many changes. The __init__ method helped set up the turtle based on the data while pulling information out of the list and creating it with the correct shape and colors. The __str__ method is able to return the string with information about the turtle in order to draw the turtle with the information given.
